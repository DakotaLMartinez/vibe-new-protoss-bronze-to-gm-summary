## Bronze to Silver
Objectives: Max out at 11 minutes, Learning Priorities, Developing Habits

#### Learning Priorties:
  - make workers (constantly until you hit between 80-84)
  - maintain optimal saturation on all bases
  - build pylons
  - when one base is saturated, build another
  - make units constantly (stalker/immortal for now)
  - efficiency (only build production facilities that you can afford to keep active 100% of the time)
    - start with 2 gates and a robo
    - build units when you can afford it (you've been constantly probing up and expanding and have money left)
    - when your money starts ramping up and your production can't keep up with your income, build more gates.
#### Developing Habits
  - making workers
  - making units when production is idle
  - building pylons so you don't supply block
  - when you max out 
    - build a couple of photon cannons in each mineral line. 
    - build extra production so you can remax quickly. 3 Robos and 15-20 gates.
    - find your opponents most recent expansion and a-move there shift a-move the rest of his bases
    - build more units as they die, build new bases as mineral patches mine out
    - fix saturation (move probes from over-saturated mineral lines to new/undersaturated ones)
#### Rough Benchmarks
- 2nd nexus starts at 1:28
- 3rd nexus starts at 3:45
- 4th nexus starts at 5:55
- max probe saturation (~80) at around 7:00
